# Gaussian elimination

Implement a program that solves a system of linear equations using the [Gaussian elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination) algoithm.

The number of variables $n$ and the matrix of the linear equations coefficients is provided as an input. The output must be $n$ values, each defining a solution for each variable in the system of the equations.
